[Code example] Read data from NetCDF
------------------------------------

Read a dataset.

.. literalinclude:: fortran/5_readgrid.f90
   :language: fortran


.. highlight:: sh

   #RedHat based systems
   gfortran -o readgrid.out readgrid.f90 -I/usr/lib64/gfortran/modules/ -lFPL
   
   #Debian based systems
   gfortran -o readgrid.out readgrid.f90 -I/usr/include/ -lFPL

.. important::
   ``-I<dir>`` This option specifies where to put .mod files for compiled modules. It is also added to the list of directories to Influencing the linking step. `See the GNU Fortran Compiler Documentation <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/>`_ .
   
   ``<dir>`` is defined in Makefile as ``$(FPL_moddir)``. See :ref:`buildlib`.
   

After compilation run the program ``./readgrid.out``
